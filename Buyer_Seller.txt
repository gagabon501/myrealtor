Here’s what the Admin/Staff “Applications” screen represents and how it fits:
Purpose: It’s the back-office queue for buyer Applications (formal “Apply” actions on published properties). Staff/Admin review and advance these applications—this is the buyer-side spine after a property is published via ATS approval.
Data shown (per row):
Created date
Property title
Applicant (email)
Status (SUBMITTED | UNDER_REVIEW | APPROVED | REJECTED | WITHDRAWN) with inline update
Notes (from the applicant)
Messages link (application message thread)
Last activity timestamp (if populated)
How it fits the overall flow:
1) Seller submits Listing Request + ATS → Staff approves ATS → Staff publishes property.
2) Property is PUBLISHED → Buyers can click Apply (deduped per property/user).
3) Those submissions land here as Applications; staff can triage and update status.
4) When staff sets status to APPROVED, the backend currently syncs the Property to RESERVED (read-only for buyer) to block new buyer actions.
5) Notifications and activity logs (from Ticket 004i) are triggered on create/status change; buyers see updates in their dashboard.
Roles: Staff/Admin only (RBAC enforced in routes and ProtectedRoute). Buyers/public cannot access this page.
Back-end linkage:
Model: Application (unique per property/user; statuses above; activity log).
Routes: /api/applications (list staff/admin); /api/applications/:id/status (status updates).
Frontend: AdminApplications.jsx table for inline status changes; message link goes to application message thread.
Operational value: Lets staff quickly see all buyer applications, update pipeline status, and open message threads. It complements Buyer Inquiries (interest leads) and the Listing Requests/ATS publishing flow.
If you’d like, I can add quick filters (status, search by property/applicant) and summary chips similar to the Buyer Inquiries enhancements to make triage faster.
